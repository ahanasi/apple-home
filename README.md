# apple-home

This project was created as part of the Odin Project [curriculum](https://theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients).
The goal was to replicate the layout of an Apple homepage using positioning techniques such as Flexbox and Grid, and mimicking any background gradients or background images.
